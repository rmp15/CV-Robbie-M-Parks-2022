\section*{Career Summary}

As an environmental epidemiologist with a background in physics, Dr. Robbie M. Parks has diverse experience in large-scale multi-disciplinary quantitative research. He is currently a NIH NIEHS K99/R00 Fellow at Columbia University. Robbie completed his PhD at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London with Profs. Majid Ezzati and Ralf Toumi in 2019. He graduated with a BA/MA (Oxon) in Physics from the University of Oxford.\\ 

\noindent While at Columbia University, Robbie has been part of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group. During his PhD, he created and co-chaired the first citizens’ climate assembly in Westminster, London, which successfully petitioned the local council to declare a climate emergency. Throughout his career, Robbie has mentored undergraduate, Master’s and PhD students. Robbie is Filipino-British, the first in his family to graduate high school, and following his undergraduate degree, spent time as a musician.

% I am an environmental epidemiologist with a background in physics working in environmental health sciences. I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at the Earth Institute, Columbia University. I am primarily interested in understanding the impact that climate, weather, and air pollution have on mortality, nutrition and disease outcomes, and how these impacts may be different in sub-groups of a population relevant to climate equity and environmental justice. I am also interested in developing new (particularly Bayesian) statistical methods, relevant to these concerns.\\

% \noindent I am well-placed to follow this trajectory through my academic background in environmental epidemiology, public health, physics, mathematics, and computing, as well as experience in local and global policy of climate change, health, and equity through my experience with the World Meteorological Organization, the Global Heat Health Information Network, and environmental justice groups.
